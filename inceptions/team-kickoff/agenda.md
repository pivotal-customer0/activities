# Agenda Details

## Intro and formalities :)

## How did we get here?
** in this segment we will have ford give a brief overview of the history leading to this point. we will go over the pitch deck and a oral history of c[0] beta and vision **

## Why am *I* here
** quick go around the table of why they opted in, why they signed up, why this is important to them **

## Let's define success for c[0]: success metrics and inovation accounting

### what does success look like for c[0]?
** in this segment we will translate the definitions of success into assumptions about what we feel it should look like once achieved **

```
- each individual writes their definition of success on a sticky or stickies. 
  as a group we de-dup and present our idea/vision of what success means for c[0].
- apply a title to each unique definition group
- give each grouping a sheet titled: `if we have achieved _____ (fill in blank w/ vision of success), 
  then we can assume that we ______ (fill in blank with something we should have achieved)`
```

- BREAK


### Success metrics and innovation accounting
** here we with to translate our above assumptions into quantifiable metrics. this will materialize into the dashboard we track our overall progress against **

```
- take our assumptions and dot vote as a group (3 dots per person)
- pull the highest impact assumptions onto a metrics sheet.
- sheet should ask the question `given _________ (fill in with assumption) we should see ____________ (fill in with key metric we wish to track)`
  - these metrics preferrably would be single units that can be scaled and developed into isolated co-horts
```
- BREAK

## Goals | Non-Goals | Guiding Principles (4 weeks)
** here we would like to begin calling out our first set of immediate goals **

```
  - define a list of goals/non-goals for the group to achieve in the first 4 weeks
    - “Guiding principles we want to follow...”
    - “The purpose of the initial 4 weeks is to...”
    - “During this inital 4-weeks we want to avoid doing...”

  - Group goals into similar buckets
  - dot rank our goals by importance (each person gets 3 votes)
```

- BREAK 

## MVPs
** taking our top goals build mvp experiments **

```
- taking our highest priority goal groups build assumptions by asking the question:
  `If we have achieved our goal of ________ (fill in goal group name) then we assume we have _________ (fill in assumption of achievment)`
- taking all of our assumptions we should rank them using 2x2 matrix (more/less impact & have/dont have information)
- in order of most important (top quadrant of 2x2 we now create (risk|ice|backlog) story mapping
  - lining up the assumptions, we then map metrics to prove/dissprove this assumption. 
  - we then map the minimum set of high level stories which need to be delivered (things to be done or built) in order to collect our validation metrics
- things we dont *need* in order to prove/disprove assumptions can be put in the icebox.
- things we see as a risk to be mitigated that does not have a corresponding story, should be logged in the risk section.
- we then rank the assumptions as a level 1, 2, 3. this is to articulate cross group  which pieces we as a group will bite off in the first pass.
```

- BREAK 

## RETRO
** classic retro on the day ( :) | :| | :( )

## Logistics & Cadence (boring stuff) discussion
- when do meetings happen?
- what do meetings cover?
- budgeting, time and expenses?
  - nothing changes from today? / pay as you go? / milestone release vc style?
  - time reporting, does this matter outside of pcfs engagements we partner on?
  - what is our budget, when is it released and how?
    - descretion and cadence around outlay?


## archive and add to backlog
- put it all in tracker
- send out the archive and images
