  - Retro output
  - Team logistical Cadence
  - c[0] Canvas

## The definition of C[0] Success is ...

### A. We Have **Artifacts** to deliver faster, better, etc on customer engagements
  - Reduce time spent resolving product issues 'on-prem' w/ cust
  - Produce field/gss artifacts that are continuous
  - Fast & reliable feedback loop between field & engineering
  - Validated ref arch of 'solutions'
  - CSO delivery kit
  - Continuous integration as organizational culture, not just engineering or internal but for customers
  - Consistency of delivery
  - Customer field activities go faster, better and more predictably as a result of the c[0] materials
  - Tested concourse pipelines that can be re-used with minimal adjustments for virtually anything the customer wants to do (PCF)

### B. Tightening of Pivotal Product Development Feedback loop
  - Issues discovered on-site for customers go to zero
  - R&D teams building products that meet customers needs in the most robust ways possible, with feedback loops running as short as possible
  - Bridge solutions (before product)

### C. Collaboration and Pairing across Engineering & Field teams
  - Transparency across business units to address core engineering concerns faced by customers
  - Customer deploys PCF the same way R&D does

### D. Customers Are Happy
  - Customers are happy with thier engagements w/ Pivotal & PCF

## Success Hypotheses

### A1. 
**If we have achieved our vision of success, defined as 
"we have artifacts to deliver faster, better, etc on customer engagements",
then we can assume that we have ...**

    - documentation, ref arch, demo, how to
    - a known method and approach for each iaas that we support

  - ability to do quick reliable pocs in the field (2 votes)
  - a repeatable streamlined process that works (0 votes)

    
### B1.

  - trust & understanding between field & R+D on best practices and approach ( 1 vote )

### C1. 
**If we have achieved our vision of success, defined as

then we can assume that we have ...**
  - Integrated teams with shared priorities ( 8 votes *most votes*)
    - shared trackers
    - field has direct view of r+d process / backlog
    - regular standup inclusion for field/eng.
  - more bugs caught prior to GA ( 3 votes)
  - a solid connection back to the docs team + gss ( 1 vote )
  - improved the gotcha moments for r+d team issues in the field ( 1 vote )

### D1. 
**If we have achieved our vision of success, defined as 
"Customers Are Happy",
then we can assume that we have ...**
  - clients with a high opinion of pivotal ( 6 votes *most votes* )
    - customers rank us highly in comparison to other IT vendors they've worked with
  - less customer churn ( 5 votes)
  - achieved more predictable support transaction times, and closer parity between client product awareness and current release (4 votes )
  - customers see a more predictable and less manual onboarding ( 3 votes)
  - c[0] gets bigger, better / dino & onsi are happy ( 2 votes )
  - faster ai consumption by customers ( 2 votes ) 

## Success Metrics

### A2. 
**I can prove my assumption of 
"pivotal has the ability to rapidly prototype, known approaches, docs and ref arch"
by measuring ...**
  - if manifests for each pivotal product can be easily consumed and run
  - if weekly drumbeats are happening
  - if there are meetings cross team at set intervals
  - if docs are accessible or linked to from docs.pivotal.io
  - if install guides exist for each iaas 
    - list of documented migration paths for upgrades w/ ref docs attached for all gtm iaas
    - pr count to docs
    - ref arch for each gtm iaas
    - delivery kit for each gtm iaas
  - *TBD* an engagement metric would be nice too

### B2. 
**I can prove my assumption of 
"pivotal has faster time delivering features to market"
by measuring ...**
  - c[0] assets consumed per 6 week dojo should increase
  - PA & partners should be able to do do solo dojos
  - time to prod for new apps during a dojo should be reduced
  - head count should be reduced on dojos
  - TTD of product patches and releases should be reduced
  - Time to a customer-like implementation of a new r+d feature
    - feature complete to feature validated cycle time
  - reduced customer escalations for non-prod on a monthly cycle
  - gss ticket volume reduced for a c[0] validated component
  - decreased time from github issue to feature delivery
  - # of alpha stage features vs. GA stage features validated by c[0]
    - alpha to ga ratio should increase in favor of alpha w/ ga being fed back to engineering responsibility
  - clients time to N in terms of upgrades of PCF. 
    - measure clients currently on n -> n-1 -> n-2, we should see the numbers shift closer to n

### C2. 
**I can prove my assumption of 
"pivotal has integrated teams with shared priorities"
by measuring ...**
  - number of man hours spent on c[0] for non core members (eng. / field ) 
  - commit count of non core c[0] members (eng. / field) 
  - attendance of inceptions for product teams by c[0] members
  - attendance of ipms for product teams by c[0] members
  - increased number of c[0] deliverables that are on the pcf priority list 
  - stories completed and delivered involving non c[0] core members
  - reduced number of blocked c[0] backlog items that are waiting on r+d involvement

### D2. 
**I can prove my assumption of 
"pivotal is held in high regard by our clients"
by measuring ...**
  - churn rate should go down
  - customer effort score should go down
  - gss should see less upgrade tickets
  - number of c[0] assets in use in prod by customers
  - customers willing to make a joint public announcement

## Retro

### :)
  - having metrics of success
  - we had the meeting
  - getting a solid start
  - co-funding (action/callout: no more cross charging)
  - great that we have a named PM
  - field & r+d shared vocab 'synergy'
  - artifacts for distributing knowledge across pivotal
  - solving a problem where silos have failed
  - will have a real impact on a big problem
  - great facilitation
  - everyone in one room

### :|
  - Enough time?
  - unclear about c[0] a year from now

### :(
  - Budget?? (action/callout: dino&evan discussion after inception)
  - Missing arni, onsi, reider, spo
  - Hard to read stickies from afar
  - missing sales
  - missing dev
  - still unsure about scope boundaries for c[0], spo, iaas enablment, etc
    - (actions/callouts:)
    - master pipeline will be long lived
    - communication across teams is a must
    - watch out for duplicate tooling from other teams
  - lots of cross talking
